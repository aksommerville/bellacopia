Bellacopia Maleficia, mark 1.
2025-12-18..2026-01-15
Abandoned after balking at the complexity introduced by repeating maps.

Major things changed for mark 2:
 - No infinite or looping edges in the world map.
 - Broom is absolute, not relative. Same style as Full Moon and Dead Weight.
 - Pause menu uses tabs instead of screen-hopping.
 - Jigsaw vellum has its own closet. Was going to do this somehow in mark 1 but hadn't decided.
 - Lighting applies to the entire framebuffer. In mark 1, there are point sources with a circular mask.
 - Map parents are per-map, not per-plane.
 - Plane zero is reserved for singleton maps, which for the most part are not special.
