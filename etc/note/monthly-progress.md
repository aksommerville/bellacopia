# Bellacopia Maleficia Monthly Progress

This is by far the largest game I've ever written.
So it's behooveful to estimate things carefully and track progress against those assumptions, for posterity's sake.
I'd like to get in the habit of making a full project review at the end of each month.

## January 2026

The ideas have been percolating for over two years, but only started work for real on 18 December 2025.
Around 15 January, had made substantial progress but threw most of it away to rework from scratch.
We're well beyond parity with that first attempt. I don't expect another restart.

You can currently reach 93% completion, and at a leisurely pace but knowing what to do, it takes about 40 minutes.
7 flowers, 5 side quests, 16 items, 3 puzzles.
Telescope and Magnifier can only be got in the Cave of Cheating.
One puzzle, the cave just south of start, is probably temporary.
The world map is noticeably sparse, biome edges are not blended at all, and jigsaw colors don't always agree across biomes.
6 battles are implemented: Fishing, Chopping, Exterminating, Boomerang, Strangling, and Laziness.
None is fully polished but all playable.
The quests that exist are mostly placeholders. Tap a stompbox to mark it complete.
Barrel Hats and Rescue the Princess are pretty much done.

One day per minigame might be too optimistic.
I earlier estimated completion in June but now I'm thinking more like 200 days, which would be September.
Maybe more like end of year.

I am feeling really good about the progress so far, and the feasibility of the project as a whole.
