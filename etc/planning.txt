Bellacopia Maleficia
Early notes, planning.

2025-11-29

The idea for Bellacopia has been percolating for over two years, since before I published Full Moon.
I'm not ready to start yet, but thought to take some notes for when I do.
This is going to be the biggest game I've ever made, by a wide margin. So do it right.

2025-12-18

I'm too excited for this. Ready or not, I'm starting.

## Technical Decisions

- Use Egg v2.
- I made two proof of concepts already, `cherteau` and `2023/bcpoc`, though there's quite a lot I want to do differently.
- Story mode, where you unlock minigames for Arcade mode.
- Arcade mode. One or two players.
- Need 100..200 minigames.
- In general, minigames should be one or two players, with a continuous difficulty scale.
- Show monsters in the outer world a la Zelda 2, so encounters are never a surprise.
- (but maybe also have monsters that can sneak up on you, esp in dark caves)
- Small HP, think Zelda. Buy hearts at blood banks, and find heart containers as treasure.
- Outer world: Continuous movement, don't quantize to cells.
- Continuously-scrolling outer world. Maps are a screenful each, but we stitch them together real-time so the user never notices the boundaries. Music, tilesheets, and sprite spawning will be tricky.
- Minigames should lead with a passive and standard controls description. eg "Hold L/R, Tap A" but graphical.
- Figure out an efficient way to make stuffed witches, and make a bunch of them to hand out at GDEX.
- At this writing, there's 7 letters remaining in my quest to fill the alphabet on Itch. Would be cool if Bellacopia finishes the set. (AJKLXY first)
- We should do an open beta when it's close to ready. Like, sending me stats from players on Itch. Include a big warning and apology, because this is not something I'd normally do.
- I want this to be huge. An arbitrary goalpost: I should not be able to finish the main quests in under an hour, even knowing the optimal path.

- How many of my little jam games can I incorporate into this?
- - See below: apothecary, cherteau, deadweight, iggle, myscrypt, pokorc, spellingbee
- - ecom could make a good one-off diegetic challenge. A door with a keystroke meter that slams shut if you move too much.
- - presto too. Rooms with a "transform everything" button.
- - ivand is basically the Building Contest.
- - ctm is more or less the Run For Mayor Quest.
- - zennoniwa is basically the Exterminating Contest.

## Narrative Notes

- Dot's 7 flowers aren't blooming, due to their being strangled by Root Devils.
- Village where the bridge is out but the mayor won't approve funding to repair it. So you have to run for mayor in order to pass.

## Toys

- Divining Rod, to show buried roots.
- Arbitrary spell-casting items?
- Fish Pole.
- Broom. Maybe you have to steal it from the Broom Race minigame? Should operate like Thirty Seconds Apothecary, not Full Moon or Dead Weight.
- Matches. Dark rooms, caves etc.
- Bug Spray. Weak monsters will avoid you.
- Candy. Draws monsters.
- Hookshot.

## Zones

Mostly following the Main Quests, some regions where there's a distinct character to each encounter.
We'll group minigames by Zone.

- Woodland. Home base. MQ 1. Lean toward silly innocent games. Generally animal opponent.
- Jungle. Exotic animals.
- Desert. MQ 3. Anything with a bridge theme, or Wild West.
- City. Will have a few of these. MQ 2. Generally human opponent, driven by professions.
- Farm. MQ 7. Human or animal (esp livestock). Lean toward practical crafts. Esp farming, obviously.
- Labyrinth. MQ 4. Mythical creatures for opponent. Extra difficulty is encouraged.
- Cave. Where the Goblins live. Maybe the same set as Labyrinth? MQ 6. Generally underground animals.
- Battlefield. MQ 5. Human opponents. Military or nautical theme. Violence encouraged.
- Taiga. Generally animal opponents. Cold theme. Ice and water.
- Sea. When you're travelling by boat.

## Side Quests

- [x] Jigsaw puzzle world map. See `xmark` project.
- - We can do 1 pixel per cell if regions never exceed 12x12 screens. I think that's enough.
- [ ] Find all the useful items.
- [ ] Some kind of korokky collectible.
- [ ] Lead livestock back to the farms.
- [ ] Lead monsters to the scientist so he can catch 'em all. Using only their natural chase instinct.
- [ ] Gyms a la Pokemon with much harder minigames, but entirely optional.
- [ ] A town where everyone is sick and you need to raise money for medicine. Just money. Incrementally heal them, but the last few will be outrageously expensive.
- - There are going to be purse upgrades. Make the final healing only affordable with the final purse.
- [x] Get a Broom for flying. Require a few main quests first, not sure how to gate that.
- [ ] Races across the world, once you have a Broom.
- [x] In the goblins' cave, a substitution cipher a la Mysteries of the Crypt.
- [x] Rescue the princess and escort her home a la Dead Weight.
- - Monsters are drawn to her instead of you, and you get to watch her play and lose the minigames.
- - Combine the cipher and the Princess, it all goes in the goblins' cave.
- - One more joke in that cave: All the monsters' names are plays on "goblin", with a related contest:
- - - Goblin: Gobbling
- - - Boblin: Apples
- - - Coblin: Cobbling
- - - Foblin: Something to do with a key fob?
- - - Globlin: Regex
- - - Hoblin: Hobbling, whatever that means.
- - - Joblin: Hiring
- - - Loblin: Throwing
- - - Moblin: Racketeering
- - - Knoblin: Something about doorknobs?
- - - Roblin: Stealing
- - - Soblin: Crying
- - - Sloblin: Laziness
- - - Snoblin: Erudition
- [ ] Various and sundry one-off fetch quests. Find my hat, etc.
- [ ] After completing a dungeon, a side quest to go back and clean up after yourself, like we did in Spelling Bee, it's hilarious.
- [ ] Buy and sell hearts at blood banks. Include at least one blood bank with a sell price high enough to encourage coin farming there.
- [ ] Fishing! You can fish anywhere there's water. And maybe standing on a tree stump, you fish birds out of the sky?
- - Fish will be currency. You can trade them for coins in the village. Some more valuable than others.
- - A special minigame to catch each fish, like Secret of Seven Sauces.
- - Fishing too much in one area, the odds of a catch decrease.
- - Can we do a complex animation for the water, with subtle hints toward the fish density there? Something hard to explain but easy to detect once you've learned how.
- - [ ] Catch a mythical sea monster in the labyrinth.
- [x] Barrel decorating. Cities have barrels everywhere, nothing apparently special. But somebody gives you Barrel Hats, one at a time, until you eventually hat every barrel in the world, with incremental prizes.
- [ ] Talking trees that are bored and want you to tell them a story. Collect stories from the elderly, all over the world. One story per tree, but it doesn't matter which.
- [ ] Scattered statues, you can move them with the hookshot. Bring them all to the town square. Think backward-Sokoban kind of puzzles.
- xxx Circumnavigate the globe. Since it's possible, there ought to be some fanfare the first time you do it.
- - 2026-01-19: That's not possible anymore.
- [ ] Inventory Judge. First he tells you to come back with 25 items in the backpack. Then he tells you to put them in alphabetical order.

## Main Quests

Ought to have seven distinct narrative quests, one guarding each Root Devil.

- [ ] 1. FARM. Unguarded. Just some random encounters. So you get your bearings first.
- [ ] 2. FRACTIA. Run for mayor.
- [ ] 3. JUNGLE S. Troll at the bridge sends you on a fetch quest. When you get back, his shift is done and the new troll sends you on a different fetch quest.
- - Basically: There's three items you need. Any that you don't have, that troll will be on duty. Stick, Compass, Candy.
- [ ] 4. JUNGLE N. Hire a guide to lead you through the deadly labyrinth -- Generate a new labyrinth for each campaign.
- - Labyrinth will have dark rooms. Ensure you can't get in without a wand.
- [ ] 5. BATTLEFIELD. Two armies at war and you can't get past. Volunteer as messenger, and take the kings' letters to Cyrano first to rewrite, so they make peace.
- [ ] 6. MOUNTAINS. Get kidnapped by goblins and escape from their cave.
- - Dark rooms, require wand.
- [ ] 7. DESERT. Toad promises to remove a boulder if you transform him into an elephant but once transformed, he renegs and goes on a rampage. Catch the elephant, turn him back into a toad, and hire a contractor instead.

## Gating.

- Root devils 1 and 5 are available immediately. 1 has no further prereqs, just take it. 5 gives you the hookshot. Most places right off the center require a hookshot to cross.
- Broom: Require 100 gold (initial purse is 99). Can be multiple ways to grow the purse. They all should be pretty heavily-guarded, and none mandatory.
- - Rescue princess. King says "that purse isn't big enough for the reward I want to give you" :)
- - XXX Hat the barrels. Requires travel all over the world, not trivial (esp without a broom!). Giving Bell for this instead; it has to be an item.
- - Labyrinth sea monster. You'd have to reach the labyrinth to get it.

1 open
2 hookshot, voting contest
3 hookshot, trolls' fetch quest
4 hookshot or war, labyrinth, wand
5 war
6 hookshot or war, goblins, wand
7 hookshot or war, wand
