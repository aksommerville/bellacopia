# Bellacopia Maleficia

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) to build.

## Timeline

2023-08-ish: Started musing on the concept.
2025-12-18: Start work in earnest.

## TODO

- [x] Modal stack.
- [ ] Outer world, first pass.
- - [x] Map loader.
- - [x] Sprite framework.
- - [x] Hero sprite, placeholder.
- - [x] World edges. Loop horizontally, after an unreasonable distance, and extend forever vertically.
- - [ ] Prevent respawn of existing sprites.
- [ ] Pole fairies: If you travel too far north or south, a pole fairy occasionally appears and offers to warp you back home.
