# Bellacopia Maleficia

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) to build.

## Timeline

- 2023-08-ish: Started musing on the concept.
- 2025-12-18: Start work in earnest.
- 2025-12-31: Assess, after 6 full days of work:
- - Got world map, one minigame, pause modal, jigsaws, physics.
- - Everything looks doable.
- - Let's figure one day per minigame, and 30 days for the rest, averaging out over work days and weekends... 159 days. Early June.
- - I'm off today. Confirm ^ that assumption by making 4 minigames. ...Finished Boomerang and Chopping over about 9 hours. One day per battle might be optimistic.
- 2026-01-01: Outer world works crudely. Jigsaws are done-ish. Dialogue and pause mostly there. 4 battles: fishing, chopping, boomerang, exterminating.
- - Reassess at the end of January to confirm we're on track to finish in June. Or at least, by GDEX.
- 2026-01-09: Finished Inversion for Uplifting Jam #6 and got right back to this. So we have scientifically established that it is possible to do game jams concurrently with Bellacopia. :)
- 2026-01-11: With stand-in root devils, tried a leisurely run without touching any cheat things: 29:14 to complete. Feeling good about the one-hour-minimum target.
- 2026-01-15: I think I fucked up coordinates management, it's becoming seriously difficult. `maps.c:physics_at_sprite_position` is broken and I'm not sure how to fix it.
- 2026-01-19: Fully committed to a rewrite. Expect mark 2 to be at parity with mark 1 before end of January.
